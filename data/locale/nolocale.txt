There's no translations as the only language I know is english and I don't wanna get anyone to do any translating because I don't have any money to give to people to translate and I'm also very nervous to do so.

If you wanna do translating, you're free to do so.

I'm not trying to be disrespectful to those who don't know english, I just don't have the motivation to learn a new language.
